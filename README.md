# SQLite-Filter-By-Date

Example of filtering an SQLite database by Date.   

Currently in the process of changing Fit Health databased from an ORM to SQLite. I need practice before I start converting databases in the main project. There will be more examples of SQLite within the next few days. 

**Project Info**
- SQLite Database
- Custom List Adapter
- Data changes with date change
- Date is saved based on current date selected.
